# InDel Workflow

A Platypus-based insertion/deletion-detection workflow with extensive quality control additions.

## Software Requirements

Most software is available in Conda, however, you additionally need Pypy -- preferentially version >= 5. You can install it via your operating system's package manager. Alternatively, you can install a portable Pypy from [squeaky-pl](https://github.com/squeaky-pl/portable-pypy), in particular if the OS version is too old (currently we use pypy 5.8).

### Conda

The workflow contains a description of a [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/) environment. A number of Conda packages from [BioConda](https://bioconda.github.io/index.html) are required. You should set up the Conda environment at a centralized position available from all compute hosts. 

First install the BioConda channels:
```
conda config --add channels r
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --add channels bioconda
```

Then install the environment

```
conda env create -n IndelCallingWorkflow -f $PATH_TO_PLUGIN_DIRECTORY/resources/analysisTools/indelCallingWorkflow/environments/conda.yml
```

The name of the Conda environment is arbitrary but needs to be consistent with the `condaEnvironmentName` variable. The default for that variable is set in `resources/configurationFiles/analysisIndelCalling.xml`.

## Data Requirements

There are quite extensive requirements in annotation etc. data required for the workflow. Please have a look at the file `resources/configurationFiles/analysisIndelCalling.xml`. Note that all VCF files need to be indexed with tabix.
